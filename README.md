# Social Web App

This repo contains the frontend for the Social Web app (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind). The backend runs separately on your VPS.

## Tech Stack
- Vite
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

## Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```
Point `VITE_API_URL` to your VPS when testing against the live backend.

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy to GitHub (push code)
1. Initialize git (if needed):
```bash
git init
```
2. Commit your code:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
3. Create a new repo on GitHub, then add the remote and push:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploy Frontend Hosting (optional)
You can host the frontend on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.  
If you use GitHub Pages with Vite, update `base` in `vite.config.ts` and follow the Vite Pages setup.

## Backend (VPS)
Keep backend code in a separate repo (recommended) or a `/backend` folder in the same repo.
Make sure your VPS API URL is exposed and set in `VITE_API_URL`.

## Notes
- `dist/` is generated by `npm run build`
- Do not commit `.env` with secrets
